Once you select your preferred language, the game then gives you the choice of one of eight combinations of gender, skin tone, hair color and eye color. You can change your hair and eye color later, but the selected gender and skin tone cannot be changed after starting. After confirming these options, the introductory cutscene begins with a live feed of the Wyndon Stadium Pitch. The current head of <a href=# title="Macro Cosmos">Macro Cosmos</a> and Chairman of the Galar Pokémon League, <a href=# title=Rose>Rose</a>, introduces not only the world of Pokémon but also the Galar Region. After a further cutscene, the camera then pans up marking the beginning the game in earnest.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Postwick>Postwick</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/7/76/Postwick_SwSh.png/450px-Postwick_SwSh.png decoding=async width=300 height=167 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>Your journey begins in <a href=# title=Postwick>Postwick</a>, a small town in the south of the <a href=# title=Galar>Galar</a> region. With a lack of any amenities and a population of only five, Postwick is the smallest town not only in Galar, but the Pokémon world.</p><table class=expandable align=center><tbody readability=1.9702380952381><tr align=center><th>Available Pokémon</th></tr><tr readability=3.8902743142145><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Your journey doesn't begin with waking up in your room for a change. Instead, you start seated on the couch in your living room watching the champion <a href=# title=Leon>Leon</a>’s exhibition match on your Rotom Phone. Your next-door neighbor and best friend, <a href=# title=Hop>Hop</a> bursts through the door with excitement, urging you to meet him at his house so that both of you can go pickup Leon (who is also Hop's older brother). Apparently, he has a present for each of you, so you better get going.</p><p>Afterward, the your mom advises you to grab your father’s old hat and bag from your room before heading out. As you head down the hill from your home, you notice that Hop has been waiting for you outside and he again urges you to come along to his house. He runs ahead, and you should follow him. Upon entering his and Leon’s house, Hop excitedly asks his mom if Leon has arrived yet. She responds that he's running late and suggests that the two of you should head over to <a href=# title=Wedgehurst>Wedgehurst</a> to meet him.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Galar_Route_1>Galar Route 1</span></h2><p><a href=# title="Galar Route 1">Galar Route 1</a> is located just to the north of Postwick. It is split into two different paths: one that’s smaller and leads straight to Wedgehurst while the other is a longer, curved path that has <a href=# title="Tall grass">tall grass</a> in which <a href=# title="Wild Pokémon">wild Pokémon</a> can be encountered. Since you have no Pokémon with you at the moment, Hop advises that you should probably stay clear of the longer path to stay safe. Take the straight path towards Wedgehurst and meet Leon at the train station.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Wedgehurst>Wedgehurst</span></h2><p>Upon first arriving in Wedgehurst, it seems that Leon’s being swarmed by his fans at the station’s entrance. While addressing the crowd and performing his signature pose, he spots Hop waving and he makes his way through the crowd to meet you both. Leon comments that it’s great to finally meet you in person and that he’s heard so much about you from Hop. He then ends his surprise meet-and-greet and then runs off towards Postwick, in spite of Hop's protests to his lack of skill with directions.</p><h2><span id=Postwick_.28Return_Visit.29></span><span class=mw-headline id=Postwick_(Return_Visit)>Postwick (Return Visit)</span></h2><p>Once you return back to Postwick and head to Hop and Leon's yard, Hop excitedly asks what sort of present Leon has brought for you both. The present in question is the Galar region’s very own <a href=# title="First partner Pokémon">first partner Pokémon</a>, Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble! A brief cutscene then plays, showing off each of their personalities and subtly demonstrating which matchups are most effective. Following this, Leon calls the three to line up so that you can choose your brand new first partner Pokémon.</p><ul><li>Being a <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Grass-type>Grass-type</a>, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Grookey>Grookey</a> has the most weaknesses out of the trio, namely <a href=# title="Fire (type)">Fire</a>, <a href=# title="Flying (type)">Flying</a>, <a href=# title="Bug (type)">Bug</a>, <a href=# title="Poison (type)">Poison</a>, and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Ice-type>Ice-types</a>. It has good <a href=# title=Stat>HP</a> and <a href=# title=Stat>Attack</a> stats, combined with a somewhat decent <a href=# title=Stat>Defense</a> stat, that makes it an excellent bulky grass type that’s able to counter any <a href=# title="Rock (type)">Rock</a>, <a href=# title="Ground (type)">Ground</a>, or <a href=# title="Water (type)">Water</a>-types that might threaten other team members.</li><li>As the representative <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Fire-type>Fire-type</a> of the region, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Scorbunny>Scorbunny</a> boasts high <a href=# title=Stat>Speed</a>, high <a href=# title=Stat>Attack</a>, and a diverse movepool which lends itself well to its role in battle as a physical sweeper. Its fire typing allows it to take care of <a href=# title="Grass (type)">Grass</a>, <a href=# title="Bug (type)">Bug</a>, <a href=# title="Ice (type)">Ice</a>, and <a href=# title="Steel (type)">Steel</a>-types with ease, though it should watch out for any <a href=# title="Water (type)">Water</a>, <a href=# title="Ground (type)">Ground</a>, or <a href=# title="Rock (type)">Rock</a>-types or any opponents, especially special attackers.</li><li>Finally, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Sobble>Sobble</a> is the <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Water-type>Water-type</a> pick and excels at taking down common types such as <a href=# title="Fire (type)">Fire</a>, <a href=# title="Ground (type)">Ground</a>, and <a href=# title="Rock (type)">Rock</a> with its high <a href=# title=Stat>Special Attack</a> and <a href=# title=Stat>Speed</a>. Combined with a large movepool with lots of coverage options, it's an efficient special sweeper that can take care of many different Pokémon. Though its low <a href=# title=Stat>Defense</a> and <a href=# title=Stat>Special Defense</a> stats means it can only take a couple of good hits, especially against <a href=# title="Grass (type)">Grass</a> and <a href=# title="Electric (type)">Electric</a>-types, before it gets knocked out itself.</li></ul><p><br>Hop will let you pick your first partner Pokémon first, since he’s got his partner <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Wooloo>Wooloo</a> with him already. All three first partner Pokémon are respectable in their own rights and all three are all eager to meet you. Just keep in mind that whoever you end up starting your journey with, Hop will always pick the first partner Pokémon that has the type disadvantage to your own, leaving the one that is advantageous against yours with Leon. Once you both pick your first partner Pokémon, you head off to bed not only tired, but excited for your first real day as a Pokémon trainer.</p><p>The next day, Hop meets you outside and tells you to meet him and Leon at their house. He comments on the Wooloo that’s trying to break through the gate keeping it from entering the Slumbering Weald, and then runs off towards his house. Hop finishes talking to his older brother and suddenly declaring you and he rivals he challenges you to your very first Pokémon battle!</p><p><br>Hop will always lead with his trusty Wooloo first, and it shouldn’t be that big of a problem to take down. Just use your starting normal type move (<a href=# title="Scratch (move)">Scratch</a> for Grookey, <a href=# title="Tackle (move)">Tackle</a> for Scorbunny, and <a href=# title="Pound (move)">Pound</a> for Sobble) to deal enough damage to knock it out. One interesting thing to note about this battle, is that Hop’s Wooloo will always yield just enough <a href=# title=Experience>experience</a> for your first partner Pokémon to level up. This level up grants them the first of many moves that apply a same type attack bonus (or STAB for short), with Grookey learning <a href=# title="Branch Poke (move)">Branch Poke</a>, Scorbunny learning <a href=# title="Ember (move)">Ember</a>, and Sobble learning <a href=# title="Water Gun (move)">Water Gun</a>. With these new moves in hand, you should be more than capable of taking down Hop’s new first partner Pokémon.</p><h5><span class=mw-headline id=First_battle>First battle</span></h5><p>Once you two finish your battle a loud crash comes from the other side of town alerting both you and Hop. You both run over towards your house to see that the gate that keeps Postwick safe from whatever is hiding in the Slumbering Weald. Moreover, the Wooloo that was trying to break down the gate is gone. With nothing else left to do but give chase, the both of you run into the Slumbering Weald to rescue the lost Wooloo.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Slumbering_Weald>Slumbering Weald</span></h2><p>Upon entering the Slumbering Weald for the first time with Hop, he expresses concern about the missing Wooloo and the thickening fog, hinting that finding the Pokémon quickly is crucial to avoid trouble. As you traverse the Weald, encounter two regional normal types, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Skwovet>Skwovet</a>, and the regional bird, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Rookidee>Rookidee</a>, in mandatory battles. Dispatch them using your attacking moves and proceed through the Weald.</p><p>After defeating the first Skwovet and Rookidee, you both hear a Pokémon's cry, prompting you to remain alert. Following the defeat of a second Skwovet, the cry grows louder, and Hop urges you to venture further into the fog out of concern for Wooloo's safety. As you catch up with Hop, the fog becomes so dense that visibility diminishes. While searching for Wooloo, a mysterious Pokémon suddenly emerges, startling both of you. A battle ensues, but there are important aspects to note.</p><p>Firstly, you cannot escape from this encounter, and secondly, none of your attacks will land on the mysterious Pokémon. Hop acknowledges this during the battle, and the opposing Pokémon uses its howl to intensify the fog. Meanwhile, Hop anxiously checks on your well-being as you navigate through the challenging situation.</p><table class=expandable align=center><tbody readability=1.9303797468354><tr align=center><th>Available Pokémon</th></tr><tr readability=3.8131868131868><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br>As the battle concludes, the fog thickens to the point of near blindness, and the mysterious Pokémon departs, causing both of you to black out. Upon regaining consciousness and rising from the ground, Leon, having grown worried, calls out to you. He had been waiting for your arrival, and when you didn't show up, he set out to find you. Despite this, Hop realizes that Wooloo still needs rescuing. However, Leon, along with his Charizard, has ensured the safety of the wayward Pokémon.</p><p>Leon acknowledges your courage in entering the forbidden Slumbering Weald and understands your motives. Hop expresses relief at Wooloo's well-being and shares his concern when the fog rolled in and the unexpected Pokémon attacked. Leon inquires about the powerful Pokémon you faced, and Hop describes its strength, commanding presence, and the peculiarity that your moves seemed ineffective against it.</p><p>Leon ponders the possibility of the legendary Pokémon in the Slumbering Weald being illusions but encourages both of you to become strong enough to uncover the truth someday. Before parting ways, Hop reflects on the shared experience, declaring it as the initial chapter in the tale of his legendary journey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX3a9sbHNnaCxcoOsvLOwvpqlnZeDnbamuMOYrpqkm6m1s7vUoJ9oi5WYwaq7zZho</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lyrics-kizz-daniel-cough.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LYRICS: Kizz Daniel Cough</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./events.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Join me next week!
