Unfortunately, not every Disney Plus show we’ve received to date is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suited to a season 2</a>. Don’t expect more Secret Invasion anytime soon, for example. But <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Moon Knight</a></strong>? Moon Knight is begging for another batch of episodes.</p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>At the end of its six-part debut season, it felt like Moon Knight had only just scratched the surface of Oscar Isaac’s multifaceted hero, especially with the post-credits scene finally revealing the existence of his third alter, Jake Lockley. And yet season 1 concluded way back in summer 2022 and we’ve still had no official update on its renewal chances. So is Moon Knight season 2 actually happening? Let’s shine some (moon)light on the subject.</p><h2 id=h-moon-knight-season-2-status-explained data-injectable=false>Moon Knight season 2 status, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Moon-Knight-e1672261181503.jpg><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>The slumbering Moon Knight fandom has been woken up of late thanks to increased chatter that Moon Knight is getting a second season. However, it’s important to note that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">these are just social media rumors</a> at this point and there has been no announcement or confirmation about season 2 to tell us it truly is happening.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>Word on the street has it that Marvel Studios is developing another run of episodes of Isaac’s Marc Spector/Steven Grant, which honestly is not the first time we’ve heard this. In fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Isaac himself has been open</a> with fans that he’s been in talks with the studio all along to return as the character(s).</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>“There have been some specific conversations,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he revealed in October 2022</a>. “They were pleasant. The spilling of the details is that there’s no details. We don’t know [if there will be a second season], but we’re talking about it.”</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, that’s about as close as we’ve come to any kind of official notice about MK‘s future, although Isaac has likewise hinted that he could one day <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">partner up with the Midnight Sons</a> in some kind of supernatural superhero team-up project. Therefore, even if a second season doesn’t happen, it doesn’t necessarily spell doom for the Star Wars star’s MCU career.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>If you believe there’s no smoke without fire, though, then the regularity and persistency of the Moon Knight season 2 rumors could well mean that Marvel really is cooking up something behind the scenes and eventually we’ll get some cast-iron proof. At San Diego Comic-Con 2024 maybe?</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, Moon Knight knights, keep showing your support for the MCU’s most dysfunctional defender. Because, as a wise man once sang, lonely is a man without love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ympqimXaC7qrPHrWSsnZGovK95kWapnpmcocZutMCpp56mmaO0bsDHnmSrrZ2kv7R5xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./natasia-demetriou.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Natasia Demetriou</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eric-bischoff-says-aews-devil-storyline-is-irrelevant-after-cm-punks-wwe-return.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eric Bischoff Says AEWs Devil Storyline is Irrelevant After CM Punks WWE Return</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./new-trader-joes-products-february-2024.html>5 New Trader Joes Products to Try: February 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-13-year-old-madeline-soto-her-disappearance-and-stepfathers-arrest-explained.html>What happened to 13-year-old Madeline Soto?
