One of the nastiest ironies is that Dahai, the miner played by Jian Wu, gets a tongue-lashing for his idealism by a character reminding him that at least the executive has made it into upper ranks, and out of their village. Dahai tries to fight some injustices, such as the mine owner failing to honor his promise to share some profits with his workers. Nothing doing, though, so when the embezzler visits in his private jet, Dahai goes bonkers with a gun. In perhaps the most memorable sequence, the docile-seeming receptionist (Tao) is set upon by a patron of the "sauna" where she works. He literally beats her up with money trying to force her into another job description: a masseuse/hooker. Finally, she turns the tables, brandishing a knife in a way to best any kung fu master.</p><p>Signature strokes of a great filmmaker come through even in a "message" movie. Startling images shot in high definition digital show the old agrarian China smashed up against the new. A horse pulling a cart without a driver goes the wrong way down a highway. Bulls peer placidly at the urban scene. But you have to know a bit about China, which most of us don't, to get that the four stories are set in different parts of this huge country: a cross-section is implied. One is clearly in the north, though, as we can figure from the snow, and characters often chat about where they are from, or guess each other's dialects. It's a world in flux.</p><p>Those who follow news in China will catch on to the televised glimpse of an incident involving a high speed train wreck, &nbsp;a disaster the Chinese government kept on the down-low. That the film is showing these things at all is some sort of minor miracle. Jia's films have been suppressed for number of years, yet he decided to go ahead and try to pass the censors this time (he did). The script for "A Touch of Sin" won best screenwriting award at Cannes this year. His earlier films include "Still Life" which showed an ancient river being wiped out as part of a dam project, and "24 City," a kind of oral history about condo development and the loss of 20,000 jobs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46aZK2npZi1brvFZqqipl1nfXJ%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./loveandlemons-recipe-browser.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>New feature: The recipe browser</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-hamill-pays-tribute-to-his-friend-treat-williams-in-heartbreaking-tweet.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mark Hamill pays tribute to his friend Treat Williams in heartbreaking tweet</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./new-trader-joes-products-february-2024.html>5 New Trader Joes Products to Try: February 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-13-year-old-madeline-soto-her-disappearance-and-stepfathers-arrest-explained.html>What happened to 13-year-old Madeline Soto?
