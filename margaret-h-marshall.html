Margaret lost her husband on March 25, 2013, due to renal and heart failure. The 75-year-old Margaret kept the sacred vow "In sickness and in health" exchanged with her husband and spent the remaining time with him until the very end of his days.</p><h2>Second Wife Of Anthony&nbsp;</h2><p>Margaret is the second wife to Anthony, who was the two times Pulitzer Prize winner for National Reporting. The Presidential Citizen Medals Winner was previously married to <strong>Linda J. Rannells </strong>on <i>July 8, 1951</i>.</p><p>The couple had three children together but got divorced in 1982.

As per sapling, the salary of Chief Justice in the United States is <strong>$223,500 </strong>in 2010. Working for more than a decade in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, she must hold a huge sum of money from her work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/15/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(1)-1576399777522.jpg><p>Margaret and her deceased husband were longtime residents of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The average cost of a house in Cambridge is <strong>$1,765,500. </strong>The couple must own a house of similar price in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&nbsp;</p><p>Marshall's Late husband Anthony was a legal journalist and public intellectual in the United States. The average salary of a journalist in the US is <strong>$40,733</strong> annually. So, after the demise of Margaret's beloved husband, she must have inherited his wealth.</p><h2>Legal Career of Hillary Marshall</h2><p>Hillary started her legal career in private practice as an associate and a partner at the Boston law firm of Csaplar & Bok from 1976 to 1989. The Chief Justice continued her private practice of law as a partner at the prominent law firm of Choate, Hall & Stewart in Boston from 1989 to 1992.

After three years of working as an Associate Justice, Republican Governor <strong>Paul Cellucci</strong> appointed her as the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.&nbsp;</p><h2>First Female To Serve As Chief Justice</h2><p>Hillary became the first woman to serve as Chief justice and the second woman to serve on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court which, the oldest appellate court in the Western Hemisphere. The liberal woman served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts for eleven long years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/16/Marshall-1576486691498.jpg><p>Being the first woman to hold that position on the Court in its more than three hundred years history, she boosted the spirit of other female law graduates to be determinant and never go for less than their capacity. Hillary Marshall authored about three hundred opinions and was involved in at least 900 other cases during her fourteen years service in the Court.</p><h2>Authorization Of Same-Sex Marriage</h2><p>Since <i>May 17, 2004,</i> same-sex marriage has been legally recognized in Massachusetts, making it the first US state to issue a marriage license to same-sex couples. Honorable Margaret H. Marshall is the author of the landmark 2003 decision that made Massachusetts the first state to legalize gay marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/15/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(3)-1576430423750.jpg><p>On March 4, 2003, the same-sex couple who were denied of marriage license filed legal action against the Massachusetts Department of Health to the Supreme Judicial Court. Previously on <i>April 11, 2001</i>, the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD)&nbsp;had already filed the case on behalf of the plaintiff couple. Still, the jurisdiction decision was in favor of the Massachusetts Department of Health, misguided by prejudice.</p><p>The Court's decision was adjourned on November 18, 2003, with a vote of 4-3, the majority opinion-making it unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples the rights and privileges associated with marriage. Margaret wrote the majority opinion in the landmark case, <i>Goodridge v. Department of Public Health.</i> Former Chief Justice of Massachusetts is the prime reformer to this tremendously courageous decision.</p><p><i><strong>For more updates, stay tuned to </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Marriedceleb</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqaYq5%2BRp7K1ecdmpJqqo52urbg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emba444-height-age-religion-nationality-wikipedia-partner-parents-gender-net-worth-709609-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emba444 Height, Age, Religion, Nationality, Wikipedia, Partner, Parents, Gender, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jackie-robinson-net-worth-212570.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jackie Robinson Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./new-trader-joes-products-february-2024.html>5 New Trader Joes Products to Try: February 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-13-year-old-madeline-soto-her-disappearance-and-stepfathers-arrest-explained.html>What happened to 13-year-old Madeline Soto?
