Don't even need to look up the cities for confirmation. Neil is Banksy, Banksy is Neil," one Art Attack superfan wrote.</p><p>Another even said they had seen Banksy around 20 years ago, admitting they wouldn't be able to identify him now. This encouraged the poster of the original tweet.</p><p>"In the late nineties/early noughties, someone pointed Banksy out to me at the Notting Hill Arts Club. I also saw him doing a stencil outside my flat in Hoxton at around the same time (hood up). Could I pick him out of a line-up? Absolutely not," they wrote.</p><p>The original poster replied: "So you wouldn't deny that it's Neil even though you've seen Banksy? This is big."</p><p>"If only he'd been wearing his Art Attack jumper," they responded.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>If only.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSus8CMmqutmZOgerTAwKtkp52ZoXqjwcKhmKeZnmKxprrInqpmm5yWtq6%2FjK2fmqxdnbK0ecGapaSrqWSVmZm3gGl7bXFslYyBqYKJjop3jaKInJZtkGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./every-attack-on-titan-opening-credit-ranked-from-best-to-peak-awesomeness.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Every Attack on Titan opening credit ranked from best to peak awesomeness</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tanya-fenmore-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tanya Fenmore Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./new-trader-joes-products-february-2024.html>5 New Trader Joes Products to Try: February 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-13-year-old-madeline-soto-her-disappearance-and-stepfathers-arrest-explained.html>What happened to 13-year-old Madeline Soto?
