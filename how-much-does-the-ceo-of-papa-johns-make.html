We also all unanimously were disappointed with the amount and distribution of toppings on the Papa John's pizzas when compared to the Domino's pizzas.<h2>How much of Papa John's does John Schnatter own?</h2>Papa John is still large, if not in charge.

The company also charges a one-time franchise fee of $25,000 for new restaurants.<h2>What happened to the CEO of Papa Johns?</h2>Schnatter stepped down as CEO in 2018 after criticizing the NFL — which had been sponsored by Papa John's — for its handling of the national anthem kneeling protests. He later resigned as chairman of the board following controversy over a training exercise he participated in, during which he used the n-word.<h2>Does Shaq own Walmart?</h2>With Shaquille O'Neal claiming to own the biggest purchase in Walmart's history, it's hard to doubt the man.<h2>Does Shaq own 5 guys?</h2>Shaquille O'Neal Owns 155 Five Guys Restaurants, 40 Fitness Centers, And 1 Movie Theater Among Other Businesses. Shaquille O'Neal is one the most dominant players in NBA history, but also one of the smartest.<h2>Does Shaq own Starbucks?</h2>In an interview from 2019, Shaquille O'Neal revealed that he had the opportunity to invest in Starbucks before Magic Johnson did.

He formerly was part-owner of 155 Five Guys restaurants.<h2>How many Papa John's does Eli Manning own?</h2>26, two days before the NFL dropped the Papa John's as its official pizza in favor of rival Pizza Hut.
