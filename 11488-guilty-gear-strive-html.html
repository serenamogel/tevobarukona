This balance is likely the most difficult part of learning how to play Axl, but with enough practice the pieces slowly fit into place.</p><ul><li>Use your 5p and 6k to keep targets at the maximum distance away and for some good poke damage.</li><li>5p goes straight forward, while 6k shoots your sickle a bit upward as a neat counter to someone trying to airdash into your face (May, I-no, and Gio are the ones to watch out for here).</li></ul><p>If you’re looking for some real damage, you’re going to have to get a bit closer. 5s and 5hs are both moves that have fairly quick startup, and have large hitboxes that work well in countering people who are mashing over and over after a knockdown, and can lead to some nifty combos too.</p><p><b>The Micro</b></p><p>During the course of the match, it is extremely important that you punish the opponent for moving in any cardinal direction, and breathing for that matter too.</p><p>If they jump from fullscreen, 6k. Closer to you and trying to overhead? 2s has you covered.</p><p>Your dust attack will likely not get used much while playing as axl, but if you manage to connect with 5k you can combo into a 2d. This can then lead to other extensions as well.</p><ul><li>If the opponent dashes, 5p.</li><li>If the opponent crouches, 2p, or 2hs for an extension.</li><li>If the opponent so much as stands still for more than half a second, send your unblockable HCFhs there way and clothesline their ass back to the lobby selection screen.</li></ul><p><b>The Macro</b></p><p>If you’re playing Axl, your goal isn’t to win matches, but to ensure that the enemy knows that they are not allowed to play the game under any circumstances, and that you have fun while doing it.</p><p>Try and mess with your opponent as much as humanly possible. Normally getting 50% without the opponent getting anywhere close to midscreen is enough to make someone put down the controller and hand you free wins, but if this strategy doesn’t work than continuously spam the move you think is both the most effective and annoying until the opponent’s mental is nothing but dust in the wind.</p><p>If by some miracle the opponent chooses to rematch, it is now your duty to pay eternal respect to them and give them the best sets of their lives. Fight an honorable battle, and show them how grateful you are that you get to play more than half a set with the same person.</p><p>However, if the opponent shows any signs of wanting to play the sixty dollar game they just bought at any point during the match, make sure you teach them a lesson and show them who the real cool guy on the block is.</p><h4>More Guides:</h4><ul><li><a href=# rel=bookmark title="Guilty Gear Strive – How to Change Resolution">Guilty Gear Strive – How to Change Resolution</a></li><li><a href=# rel=bookmark title="Guilty Gear Strive – Quick Low End PC Optimization Guide">Guilty Gear Strive – Quick Low End PC Optimization Guide</a></li><li><a href=# rel=bookmark title="Guilty Gear Strive – How to Turbo Sol">Guilty Gear Strive – How to Turbo Sol</a></li><li><a href=# rel=bookmark title="Guilty Gear Strive – How to Remove Bloom/Blur + Best Settings for Online">Guilty Gear Strive – How to Remove Bloom/Blur + Best Settings for Online</a></li><li><a href=# rel=bookmark title="Guilty Gear Strive – How to Play Anji Mito">Guilty Gear Strive – How to Play Anji Mito</a></li></ul>Written by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Majinks</a><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaKysbjAsmWtoaCofKjByJ2crGdhZoF5hIygrKKkpK56qLHAq2SsrKKew6Z6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-war-zone-2000.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The War Zone movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2000)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-hurt-this-man-cyberbully-ceo-gets-fired-by-tiktok-for-coming-after-young-woman-for-the-weirdest-of-reasons.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who hurt this man?: Cyberbully CEO gets fired by TikTok for coming after a young woman for the</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./new-trader-joes-products-february-2024.html>5 New Trader Joes Products to Try: February 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-13-year-old-madeline-soto-her-disappearance-and-stepfathers-arrest-explained.html>What happened to 13-year-old Madeline Soto?
