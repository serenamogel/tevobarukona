class="content post__content clearfix"><p><span>She’s the latest addition to the Kardashian clan, and the mother of the latest Kardashian in town, so there’s no doubt that this is a hot topic.&nbsp;Before we get into the subject of Blac Chyna’s height and other body stats, here’s some background information about the vixen herself.</span></p><p><span>If it wasn’t immediately obvious that ‘BlacChyna’ is a nickname, then there’s a problem.&nbsp;Anyway, her real name is Angela Renée White and she was born on May 11, 1988 to Shalana Jones-Hunter and Eric Holland.&nbsp;Her screen name was not always Blac Chyna, but at the time (2010) she stripped down to the nickname “Cream”.&nbsp;In fact, she got her current name from a strip club regular.</span></p><p><span>The man called himself “Black China” because he was a black man with Chinese eyes and she could understand that.&nbsp;Later that year, Chyna posed for the cover of&nbsp;</span><i><strong><span>Dime</span></strong>&nbsp;</i><span>magazine and it was the first of many magazine covers to come.&nbsp;The same year, she began to appear in music videos, which earned her the title of “video vixen”.</span></p><p><span>She is now a proud entrepreneur and owner of an online store ’88fin’ and a beauty bar ‘LASHED’.&nbsp;Unfortunately, she’s more popular due to her involvement with the Kardashians than her personal accomplishments, but we bet it’s still good for business.</span></p><p><span>Before we get too engrossed in her story, let’s dive into the subject by starting with Blac Chyna.</span></p><p><span>See also: Kanye West’s mom and kids: Everything you need to know</span></p><h2><span>Height of Blac Chyna</span></h2><p><span>You don’t need any visual support to tell you that it’s really, really short.&nbsp;Blac Chyna is not that tall at 5ft 2in.&nbsp;It’s funny that she doesn’t look so short on camera, because she has that “tall and chunky” figure, but her height earns her a spot on the list of shortest celebrities in Hollywood.</span></p><p><span>To prove it to you, here is a list of short celebrities who are shorter than Blac Chyna.&nbsp;Her sister-in-law, Kim Kardashian West (5ft 3in), Mila Kunis (5ft 3in), Britney Spears (5ft 4in) and Sarah Jessica Parker (5ft 4in).</span></p><p><span>These are people that other celebrities dominate. Hopefully, this gives an accurate idea of ​​how short-lived it was.&nbsp;If not, there are a few people who stand as “tall” as she does.&nbsp;Nicki Minaj, Shakira and Alyssa Milano share all the qualities of Blac Chyna.</span></p><p><span>See also: Kylie Jenner’s lip and nose job;&nbsp;Before and after surgery</span></p><h2><span>Blac Chyna Weight</span></h2><p><span>She was a stripper before, she’s no doubt kept the flesh where she wants it and lost weight where it counts.&nbsp;Chyna, who has just given birth to Rob Kardashian’s first child, weighed 61 kg (135 lbs) before her pregnancy and she has been very careful with her weight, especially during pregnancy.</span></p><p><span>At first, she revealed to her fans on instant chat that she was willing to gain 100 pounds during her pregnancy, but she took it back and decided to control her pregnancy weight by exercising two times a day, combined with a strict diet.&nbsp;Here’s what she said in her Snapchat video after losing a few pounds of pregnancy.</span></p><p><span>“I started eating cleaner and walking, 135 to 183 to 176.2.&nbsp;“Although this is the case for Chyna, pregnant women should probably check with their gynecologist before dieting and exercising, we just added this part for safety reasons.</span></p><p><span>Now, two weeks after the birth of baby Dream (yes, seemingly weird baby names growing later in the family), Blac Chyna has made some serious progress on her post-body goals.&nbsp;She’s lost 10kg (23lbs) and rumor has it that her baby daddy, Rob, is a bit envious.&nbsp;Can you blame him?</span></p><p><span>She’s through something that’s a constant struggle for him.&nbsp;She looks so good and her stomach is already flat, but we still hope he can turn that craving into inspiration.</span></p><h2><span>Blac Chyna Body Net Worth</span></h2><p><span>Besides Blac Chyna’s height and weight, here is a summary of his other measurements.</span></p><p><span>Height: 5’2</span></p><p><span>Weight: pre-baby-61 kg, post-baby-76 kg, goal-58 kg</span></p><p><span>Cup size: 32 D</span></p><p><span>Chest size: 36 inches</span></p><p><span>Waist size: 27 inches</span></p><p><span>Hips size: 41 inches</span></p><p><span>Dress Size: US 10, Euro 40, UK 12</span></p><p><span>Shoe size: US 8, Euro 38-39, UK 6</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGianJawbq%2FHsqWaZZiatqi002aunqGXncFurc2dZJunlK56rrHArKyrnZ2au7W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-there-a-place-to-stream-jeopardy-after-live-episodes-air.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is there a place to stream Jeopardy! after live episodes air?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./resident-evil-4-missing-popular-feature-nintendo-switch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Resident Evil 4 Is Missing A Popular Feature On Nintendo Switch</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./new-trader-joes-products-february-2024.html>5 New Trader Joes Products to Try: February 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-13-year-old-madeline-soto-her-disappearance-and-stepfathers-arrest-explained.html>What happened to 13-year-old Madeline Soto?
