Lenny Bruce was renowned for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity.</strong></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=lenny-bruce-early-life></span>Lenny Bruce Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He grew up in nearby Bellmore. His parents divorced before he turned 10, making him live with various relatives over the next decade.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=lenny-bruce-education></span>Lenny Bruce Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As of his studies, the stand-up comedian attended Wellington C. Mepham High School.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=lenny-bruce-career></span>Lenny Bruce Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bruce is credited for paving the way for potential provocative comedians of the counterculture era, and his conviction for obscenity is seen as a milestone in the United States for freedom of speech.</p><p>In 2017, he was ranked third by Rolling Stone magazine (behind disciples Richard Pryor and George Carlin) on his list of the 50 best stand-up comics ever.</p><p>After spending time working on a farm, Bruce joined the United States Navy at the age of 16 in 1942. In May 1945, after a comedic performance for his shipmates in which he was dressed in drag, his commanding officers became upset.</p><p>He defiantly persuaded the medical officer of his ship that he had gay urges. It led in July 1945 to his unacceptable discharge.</p><p>He had not, however, admitted or been found guilty of any infringement of naval regulations and successfully applied for his discharge to be changed to “Under Honorable Conditions because of the inadequacy of naval service.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lenny-bruce-age></span><span>Lenny Bruce Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bruce was born on 13 October 1925 in Mineola, New York, <strong>United States of America</strong>. He celebrated his birthday on 13th October every year.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lenny-bruce-family></span><span>Lenny Bruce Family</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=parents></span>Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>His British-born father, Myron Mickey Schneider, was a shoe clerk, and the two saw each other very infrequently.</p><p>Bruce’s mother, Sally Marr, legal name Sadie Schneider, born Sadie Kitchenberg, was a stage performer and had an enormous influence on Bruce’s career.</p><p>After a short stint in California spent living with his father, Bruce settled in New York City, hoping to establish himself as a comedian.</p><p>Soon afterward, in 1947, just after changing his last name to Bruce, he earned $12 and free spaghetti dinner for his first stand-up performance in Brooklyn.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=lenny-bruce-wife></span>Lenny Bruce Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bruce was married to his lovely wife, Honey Harlow. The couple tied their knot in 1951 and together they are blessed with one child namely, Kitty.</p><p>Harlow was a stripper from Manila, Arkansas. Her husband urged her to quit stripping. The couple left New York in 1953 for the West Coast, where they got work as a double act at the Cup and Saucer in Los Angeles.</p><p>Harlow found a job at the Colony Club, which at the time was widely known as Los Angeles ‘ finest burlesque club.</p><p>Bruce left Strip City in late 1954 and found work within the San Fernando Valley at a variety of strip clubs. As the master of ceremonies, he introduced the strippers while performing his own ever-evolving material.</p><p>The stand-up comedian had an affair with jazz singer, Annie Ross, in the late 1950s and in 1959, Lenny’s divorce from Honey was finalized.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=children></span><span>Children</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bruce and Harlow were blessed with a daughter in 1955 and named her Kitty Bruce. She is the one and only child Bruce. It is through Kitty that the spirit of her father lives on, as she is vocal about just what it is that she believes in.</p><p>The Lenny Bruce Memorial Foundation commemorates her father in a tasteful way that means a lot to not just his legacy, but also to Kitty.</p><p>It seems as if the legend of Lenny Bruce is still alive and well today, within the youth of America. He’s actually celebrated way more today than he ever was when he was alive.</p><p>More and more young people, aged around 20 or so, seem to be introduced to the brilliance of Lenny Bruce via the internet.</p><p>It was a moment of realization that spawned an entire movement, all helmed by Kitty herself. She put her house up for a mortgage and found a gigantic 16-room facility that would become Lenny’s House.</p><p>She then sought out to help women who had suffered substance abuse issues transition back into the frightening elements that come with the real world after you’ve been disconnected for so long.</p><p><strong>Lenny Bruce Family</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lenny-bruce-body-measurements></span><span>Lenny Bruce Body Measurements</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Height:&nbsp;</strong>Not Available</li><li><strong>Weight: </strong>Not Available</li><li><strong>Shoe Size:&nbsp;</strong>Not Available</li><li><strong>Body Shape</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Hair Colour:&nbsp;</strong>Not Available</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lenny-bruce-net-worth></span><span>Lenny Bruce Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Working as a stand-up comedian, there is no doubt Bruce earned a good salary and accumulated good net worth.
