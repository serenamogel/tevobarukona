Maybe I can back into the movie by observing the all-star gallery of dependable romantic comedy stars, led by <a href=#>Hugh Grant</a>, and you know what? Little by little, a movie at a time, Grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian. He's getting to be one of those actors like <a href=#>Christopher Walken</a> or William Macy where you smile when you see them on the screen. He has that Cary Grantish ability to seem bemused by his own charm, and so much self-confidence that he plays the British prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport.</p><p><a href=#>Emma Thompson</a> plays his sister, with that wry way she has with normality, and <a href=#>Alan Rickman</a> plays her potentially cheating husband with the air of a lawyer who hates to point out the escape clause he's just discovered. <a href=#>Laura Linney</a> plays his assistant, who is shy to admit she loves her co-worker Karl (<a href=#>Rodrigo Santoro</a>), who is also shy to admit he loves her, and so you see how the stories go round and round.</p><p>Oh, and the prime minister walks into 10 Downing Street his first day on the job and Natalie the tea girl (<a href=#>Martine McCutcheon</a>) brings him his tea and biscuits, and the nation's most prominent bachelor realizes with a sinking heart that he has fallen head over teapot in love. "Oh, no, that is <i><i>so</i></i> inconvenient," he says to himself, with the despair of a man who wants to be ruled by his head but knows that his netherlands have the votes.</p><p>Wandering past these lovable couples is the film's ancient mariner, a broken-down rock star named Billy Mack, who is played by <a href=#>Bill Nighy</a> as if <a href=#>Keith Richards</a> had never recorded anything but crap, and knew it. By the time he is 50, <a href=#>George Orwell</a> said, a man has the face he deserves, and Nighy looks as if he spent those years turning his face into a warning for young people: Look what can happen to you if you insist on being a naughty boy.</p><p>Billy Mack is involved in recording a cynical Christmas version of one of his old hits. The hit was crappy, the Christmas version is crap squared, and he is only too happy to admit it. He is long past pretending to be nice just because he's on a talk show. At one point he describes his song with a versatile torrent of insults of which the only printable word is "turd," and on another show when he's told he should spend Christmas with someone he loves, he replies, "When I was young, I was greedy and foolish, and now I'm left with no one. Wrinkled and alone." That this is true merely adds to his charm, and Nighy steals the movie, especially in the surprising late scene where he confesses genuine affection for (we suspect) the first time in his life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lpq%2BdXZawtcHApaOyZWJlfXQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sasha-banks-bio-age-career-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sasha Banks Bio, Age, Career, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-duval-bio-age-net-worth-profession.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Duval Bio, Age, Net Worth, Profession</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./new-trader-joes-products-february-2024.html>5 New Trader Joes Products to Try: February 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-13-year-old-madeline-soto-her-disappearance-and-stepfathers-arrest-explained.html>What happened to 13-year-old Madeline Soto?
