After marrying NBA player <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/stephen-curry data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stephen Curry" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stephen Curry</a> in 2011, she channeled her love for cooking into a blog and YouTube channel. Tapped to host her own program on the Food Network in 2016, she has also branched out by authoring a cookbook, opening multiple restaurants and launching a cookware line.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ayesha Disa Alexander was born on March 23, 1989, in Ontario, Canada, and grew up in the Toronto suburb of Markham. Her father, a musician, took her name from the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/stevie-wonder data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stevie Wonder" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stevie Wonder</a> song "Isn't She Lovely," about the legendary singer's daughter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Curry was inspired by kitchen activity at a young age; with her mom running a salon out of the basement, Curry would watch her babysitter prepare Trinidadian curry and roti, and then bring the food down to customers. She was also influenced by her surrounding neighborhood, with scents of Indian, Ethiopian, Greek and Chinese food wafting from every corner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Curry was 14 years old when her family uprooted from Canada to resettle in North Carolina.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Acting Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With her stunning looks, Curry moved to Los Angeles after high school to pursue a career in Hollywood. She earned guest spots on several TV shows, including the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/miley-cyrus data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Miley Cyrus" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Miley Cyrus</a>-headlined Hannah Montana, and landed a starring role on a drama called Whittaker Bay, which endured for eight episodes in 2008. Curry abandoned her career after an appearance on the sitcom Good Luck Charlie in 2010, though she later surfaced in an episode of the sports-themed Ballers, as herself.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Romance and Marriage to Stephen Curry</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ayesha first met her husband, NBA MVP Stephen Curry, at age 14, while both were members of the Central Church of God in Charlotte, North Carolina. Although they bonded over a shared love of Canadian candy — Steph lived in Toronto while his father finished up his own NBA career — Ayesha was not allowed to date in high school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Their romance ignited a few years later, while Ayesha was living in Los Angeles and Steph, a hotshot college basketball player, was in town for a sports awards show. She soon moved back to Charlotte, close to where Steph was attending Davidson College, and the two married in their hometown on July 30, 2011.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Culinary Businesses</h2><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Cooking Shows</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2016 Curry began hosting her own cooking show for the Food Network. Initially called Ayesha's Homemade and later rebranded as Ayesha's Home Kitchen, the program showcases the busy mom whipping up meals for her family, with her famous husband and children known to surface.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2017 Curry was named a co-host for the third season of The Great American Baking Show, though the program was pulled from the air after a judge was accused of sexual misconduct. She has also served as a judge on the Food Network shows Chopped Junior and Guy's Grocery Games, and showed off her skills on The Rachael Ray Show and Good Morning America.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Cookware and Home Delivery</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After producing her own brand of aprons and olive oil, Curry in 2017 launched an eponymous line of cookware that included kitchen standards like pots and pans, as well as more distinct items like a bacon grease jar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That year she also debuted her meal kit delivery service, Homemade, designed to appeal to families with its kid-friendly options and coloring books.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Cookbook and Recipes</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In September 2016, Curry published her first cookbook, The Seasoned Life. A New York Times best-seller, the book is comprised of more than 100 of the author's favorite recipes, including salt-baked branzino, Asian pear salad and homemade granola. The Seasoned Life also features contributions from her husband.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Websites and Channels</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Curry's career as a culinary and media personality began after she gave birth to her first child in 2012. The following year, she launched her Little Lights of Mine blog and YouTube channel to share her love for cooking and other activities that brought light into her life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Little Lights of Mine eventually evolved into goInspo, an interactive community she says is "dedicated to people who passionately live, love, share and inspire." Additionally, she runs her own website, a hub to promote her recipes, products and other endeavors.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Instagram and Twitter</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with her professional presence online, Curry posts plenty of adorable baby and family photos for her followers on Instagram and Twitter. And while not known to be combative or overtly political, she hasn't shied away from the sort of posts likely to draw backlash. In one instance she tweeted, "Everyone's into barely wearing clothes these days huh? Not my style. I like to keep the good stuff covered up for the one who matters," which prompted replies that she was being judgmental.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2017 she was drawn into President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Trump</a>'s Twitter orbit after her husband openly questioned whether he would visit the White House as part of his team winning the NBA championship. After the president tweeted that the invitation was withdrawn, she responded with an eye-roll emoji.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Kids and Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Currys had their first child, Riley Elizabeth, in July 2012. Riley became a media sensation after crashing her dad's postgame press conference in May 2015, in which she waved at reporters and ordered others to be quiet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the time, Curry was well along with pregnancy No. 2; she gave birth to a second daughter, Ryan Carson, in July. After announcing that little Curry No. 3 was on the way in February 2018, she delivered son Canon W. Jack on July 4, 2018.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She says shared religious faith keeps the bond strong with her husband; as emblematic of the busy, modern family, they watch a live stream of their North Carolina church on Sundays.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Curry has served as an ambassador for No Kid Hungry, which aims to end childhood hunger, and has also partnered with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/michelle-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michelle Obama" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michelle Obama</a> and Team FNV to promote healthy eating choices.</p><ul data-node-id=35 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1989</li><li>Birth date: March 23, 1989</li><li>Birth City: Toronto, Ontario</li><li>Birth Country: Canada</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Ayesha Curry is a TV personality and entrepreneur known for hosting a Food Channel program and her culinary products.
