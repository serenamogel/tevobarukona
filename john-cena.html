Calling himself "The Prototype," he captured the UPW title in 2000. In 2001, he signed a contract to work at Ohio Valley Wrestling. Cena claimed the OVW heavyweight title in February 2002, then made his WWE debut that June. Two years later, he took the United States Championship. The wrestler has since expanded his brand through the release of a hip-hop album and appearances on TV and film.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">John Felix Anthony Cena was born on April 23, 1977, in West Newbury, Massachusetts, the second of John Sr. and Carol Cena's five boys.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At an early age, Cena showed a passion for sports and working out. By the time he was 15, he was a regular gym rat and after graduating high school, Cena headed off to Springfield College in Massachusetts to study exercise physiology and prove his worth on the football field. At Springfield, Cena turned himself into a Division III All-American offensive lineman and team captain.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2000, the new college graduate left Massachusetts despite his father's wishes, seeking a new life in California as a bodybuilder. It wasn't an easy transition for the 6-foot 1-inch aspiring star. He had just $500 in his pocket to make it across the country and get settled. To make ends meet, he folded towels and cleaned toilets at a Gold's Gym in Venice Beach. Since he couldn't afford an apartment, he shacked up in his 1991 Lincoln Continental.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Foray into Wrestling</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cena's turning point came in early 2000, during a casual conversation he had with a wrestler at Gold Gym's who encouraged him to take classes at Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), a former World Wrestling Entertainment developmental company.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For Cena, the suggestion of making a go of it as a wrestler was not an entirely outlandish idea. His father, John Sr. (a.k.a. Johnny Fabulous), made a living as a wrestling announcer and businessman. As a kid growing up in suburban Massachusetts, the younger Cena spent many hours glued to the television set as he watched his wrestling heroes such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/hulk-hogan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hulk Hogan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Hulk Hogan</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/ultimate-warrior data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ultimate Warrior" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ultimate Warrior</a> and Shawn Michaels go at it in the ring.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a wrestler himself, Cena's ascension was rapid. Calling himself "The Prototype," the ambitious Cena captured the UPW title on April 27, 2000, in San Diego, California. Over the course of the next year, Cena drew the attention of WWE executives, and in 2001, the young entertainer signed a developmental contract with the company to work at Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW).</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">WWE Debut and Champion</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cena captured the OVW heavyweight title in February 2002, then made his WWE debut that June when he signed up with the Smackdown roster. Just two years later, Cena took home the United States Championship, defeating The Big Show in March 2004 in Wrestlemania XX.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the years since, Cena has notched many wins and titles. In 2007, he became the first wrestler to ever come up victorious against Edward "Umaga" Fatu.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along the way, Cena, whose good looks and sculpted body inspired the nickname "The Marky Mark of Wrestling," greatly increased his celebrity. Like Hogan, Cena proved that his showmanship in the ring translated to success in other venues.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">TV, Movies and Music</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Through the production wing of WWE, Cena starred in the action films The Marine (2006) and 12 Rounds (2009), the latter featuring the wrestler trying to save his girlfriend from a gang of terrorists in New Orleans.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Album: 'You Can't See Me'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition, Cena, who has long had an affinity for hip-hop culture, became a recording artist when his rap album, You Can't See Me, hit record stores in 2005. The recording debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at No. 15.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Trainwreck'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2015, Cena received critical praise for his acting skills in the hit comedy Trainwreck, directed by Judd Apatow and written by the film's star, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/amy-schumer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amy Schumer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Amy Schumer</a>. Cena played Schumer's muscle-bound but sensitive boyfriend. “I got my chance to throw my sense of humor out into the world, and at the same time play this hulky guy who’s a softy, which in real life I’m a very emotional guy,” Cena told Business Insider. Later that year he appeared in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/tina-fey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tina Fey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tina Fey</a>-<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/amy-poehler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amy Poehler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Amy Poehler</a> comedy Sisters and had a small role in Daddy's Home.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Blockers,' 'Bumblebee'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Devoting more time to his screen pursuits, Cena in 2017 co-starred in the war film The Wall, voiced the titular bull of the animated Ferdinand and rejoined <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/will-ferrell data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Will Ferrell" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Will Ferrell</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/mark-wahlberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mark Wahlberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mark Wahlberg</a> for Daddy's Home 2. The following year, he enjoyed a prominent role in the raunchy comedy Blockers, before returning to action fare with the Transformers spinoff Bumblebee. Cena then joined Keegan-Michael Key and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/john-leguizamo data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Leguizamo" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Leguizamo</a> to play a trio of wildfire fighters flummoxed by unruly kids in the 2019 family comedy Playing with Fire.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader?' Host</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also in 2019, it was announced that Cena would host a new version of the game show Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader?, a gig previously belonging to comedian <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jeff-foxworthy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jeff Foxworthy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jeff Foxworthy</a>. Prior to its debut in June, Cena pointed out the similarities between entertaining audiences as a wrestler and as a TV personality, and said the latest version of the show would focus more on the kids than the adult contestants.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cena married his girlfriend, Elizabeth Huberdeau, in July 2009. In May 2012, Cena filed for divorce, allegedly shocking Huberdeau. Their messy separation played out in the media, but they eventually settled in July of that year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2012, Cena began dating fellow WWE superstar Nikki Bella. On April 2, 2017, he proposed to Bella after they defeated The Miz and Maryse in a tag team match at Wrestlemania 33. Cena and Bella ended their engagement in April 2018, and briefly reconciled before it was reported that they had again gone their separate ways.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following year, the wrestler turned actor began dating engineer Shay Shariatzadeh. The pair was married in October 2020.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=33 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: John Cena</li><li>Birth Year: 1977</li><li>Birth date: April 23, 1977</li><li>Birth State: Massachusetts</li><li>Birth City: West Newbury</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: John Cena is a professional wrestler who took home the United States WWE Championship in March 2004 and has since expanded his career into movies and television.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Action</li><li>Sports</li><li>Television</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Taurus</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Springfield College</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=36><ul data-node-id=38 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: John Cena Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/athletes/john-cena</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: June 7, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYraCcmsGmv46jpqGmXZiyr60%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-fr-angelo-artemas-illness-before-death-explained-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Fr Angelo Artemas?
