He invites a small group of individuals, but just enough to keep the drama running for the following few episodes. Luis, who had hoped to pursue Francine Koffie aka Fantana, was devastated to find that she was hooking up with Diamond Platnumz.</p><p>Swanky sensed that Luis was interested in Fantana, but he had no idea what Fantana wanted. With Diamond's baby momma Zarinah Hassan aka Zari present as well, there was ready fuel for drama in the situation.</p><p>Zari claimed to be not affected by Fantana and Diamond's relationship but hoped "he doesn't pull a Nadia on you." She lets her know how being with Diamond with her still in the picture will never lead to anything good. Diamond claims he already has an agreement with Fantana where they agreed they both can see other people.&nbsp;"When I step in the room, it's not gonna be about you, Fantana," Zari reminds her.</p><p>Hearing Fantana speak of her agreement with Diamond, Luis intervenes, "Don't be another Diamond side chick." Fantana was taken aback by the remark. He attempts to explain himself by stating that people should pay attention to her songs since he believes she is excellent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/a89905fd-5673-44bd-b897-15474ff241ae.png><h2 class=split>'Don't ever, please, depreciate a woman like that'</h2><p>Bonang assumed right away that Luis only wanted to be on "Fantana's list." She goes off on him, asking if he believes guys are the only ones who have a list of people they're dating at the same time. "Darling, I have a list of men I would sleep with and leave," she says. "Don't ever, please, depreciate a woman like that."</p><p>In his defense, Luis claims to be looking out for her. Fantana believes that if Luis had been in place of Diamond, he would have been fine with the scenario.&nbsp;Bonang then lashes out at Luis, asking if he is trying to "tell women about the activities of their vaginas." Luis tries to blame it on social conventions, claiming that Fantana will be called out for having multiple partners, but Diamond will not. When Bonang claims that society can focus on both her music and her personal life, Luis responds, "No, they can't!"</p><p>Swanky seemed perplexed as to why Luis was arguing. He was curious whether Luis actually cared about Fantana's career or was simply attempting to replace Diamond. &nbsp;Luis says he doesn't want Fantana to be associated with a "sex scandal." Bonang was perplexed by Luis' statement, as she claimed to have slept with Africa's top stars and was "still standing."</p><p>"Bonang is trying to make me out to seem like I'm trying to control Fantana," Luis believes. "She's trying to make me out to seem like a misogynist. She's trying to paint me as this guy, this typical African man who's not for women's rights, and that is not the case."&nbsp;Luis, according to Bonang, is a liar who "wants to assume roles for women."</p><p><strong>'Young, Famous & African' Season 2 is currently streaming on Netflix</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRosZ%2Bqu6h5xZqkqK2jYq6nvsicmKdlkqS7orrGZqSarJiar6J50qWYpqtdocKqv4ymrKeZnpZ6p7vRZpqapJyeu6h5xZqlrZmelnqltcCmpqeco2LAqrDEZpqhoZOg</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./iron-chef-star-cat-coras-wife-nicole-ehrlich-files-for-divorce-after-three-years-of-marriage.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Damian Lillard 'files for divorce from wife Kay'La Lillard after two years of marriage due to irreco</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./uberhaxornovas-net-worth-age-height-weight-girlfriend-dating-bio-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>UberHaxorNovas Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./new-trader-joes-products-february-2024.html>5 New Trader Joes Products to Try: February 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-13-year-old-madeline-soto-her-disappearance-and-stepfathers-arrest-explained.html>What happened to 13-year-old Madeline Soto?
