He wrote his hit song "Uptown Girl" about her, though she later admitted to <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> she had no idea who he was when they first met at a party in St. Bart's with other famous faces, including Whitney Houston. They married in 1985 aboard a yacht in the Hudson River. Per the&nbsp;AP, the wedding had 200 guests.</p><p dir=ltr>The following year,&nbsp;Billy spoke about all the attention the marriage brought the couple in an interview with <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>. He bristled at the idea that he had "mellowed out,"&nbsp;while also taking issue with the idea that he and Brinkley had some fabulous lifestyle.&nbsp;"it bothered us, because it made us seem as if we were these social butterflies, and we're not like that at all,"&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;"We're pretty low-key people. We enjoy very simple things." Brinkley agreed, telling <a href=#>Sports Illustrated</a> that they had to use fake names — Rocky and Sandy Shore — while checking into hotels so that they could avoid the paparazzi. "I had no idea what I&nbsp;was getting into,"&nbsp;she said.</p><p>They divorced in 1994, but have remained close over the years. They have a daughter together, Alexa Ray Joel, who has followed in her father's musical footsteps. And of course, her parents are proud. When&nbsp;<a href=#>Social Life Magazine</a>&nbsp;asked Brinkley to name her top musicians in 2019, she replied, "Alexa, Joni Mitchell, and Billy Joel."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmboNygI6tn55lkp60qLHSrWRqcWhlwG68zrCcq2WTpMKxuMSsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./william-girdler.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>William Girdler movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./coco-jack-gillies-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-242959-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Coco Jack Gillies Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./new-trader-joes-products-february-2024.html>5 New Trader Joes Products to Try: February 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-13-year-old-madeline-soto-her-disappearance-and-stepfathers-arrest-explained.html>What happened to 13-year-old Madeline Soto?
