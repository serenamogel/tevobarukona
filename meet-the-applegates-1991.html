Like the pod people in "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," they presumably have plans to take over society, replacing one family at a time until everyone is an insect and the charade can be discontinued.</p><p>Dick Applegate is played by <a href=#>Ed Begley</a> Jr. - tall, blond and vaguely Gary Cooperish - who is always being cast as a typical American in movies where the typical is bizarre. Remember him as one of William Hurt's goofy brothers in "<a href=#>The Accidental Tourist</a>," or Roseanne Barr's husband in "<a href=#>She-Devil</a>"? This time he's a stern team leader who delivers dinnertime lectures on the correct mispronunciation of "nuclear." Jane Applegate is <a href=#>Stockard Channing</a> in a perky blond wig, like <a href=#>Doris Day</a> with a nasty little secret. <a href=#>Dabney Coleman</a> makes a cameo appearance as "Aunt Bea," an insect that disguises itself as a woman but forgets that human women do not have Dabney Coleman moustaches.</p><p>The Aunt Bea joke gets old in a hurry, and indeed "Meet the Applegates" is a one-joke movie. If you think it is funny that insects would serve a large bar of chocolate in place of a pot roast, then you will laugh, once, when they do so, but as the same kinds of jokes are replayed over and over the movie gradually grows dispiriting.</p><p>"Meet the Applegates" does, however, raise a larger question: Why is it that so many filmmakers have assumed that the most grotesque and unspeakable practices go on behind the drawn blinds of suburbia? Are these movies being made for suburban high school kids, many of whom have probably always suspected that their neighborhoods are populated by insects in disguise? Who do we have to thank for the vision behind, or beneath, this movie? The answer, I am afraid, is that <a href=#>David Lynch</a> has indirectly inspired many dirty-secrets-of-suburban movies with "<a href=#>Blue Velvet</a>," a movie that - whatever you may have thought of it - was at least original, and with "Twin Peaks," a television series that - whatever you may think of it - is Lynch repeating himself. He at least had some kind of point he was trying to make (I think it was that the Troy Donahue and <a href=#>Sandra Dee</a> romantic comedies were encoded calls of despair), but movies like "Meet the Applegates" exist all on one level, the most shallow.</p><p>Is there a satirical point here? Parallels we can draw with real life? Lessons to learn? "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" was widely read as a social commentary in which individualism was under attack by sinister foreign forces. But this movie doesn't even seem to have a point of view - unless it's something on the level of Stupid Pet Tricks, in which human behavior becomes funny when it's mimicked by life forms that do not quite understand what they're doing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46mnJ6sXam1pnnAqaelnZeWwaa%2FjGpwcmk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nick-offerman-and-megan-mullally-relationship-timeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally relationship timeline</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./levi-jed-murphy-before-surgery-photos-and-boyfriend-everything-on-levijedmurphy-tiktok-star.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Levi Jed Murphy Before Surgery Photos and Boyfriend: Everything On Levijedmurphy TikTok Star</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./new-trader-joes-products-february-2024.html>5 New Trader Joes Products to Try: February 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-13-year-old-madeline-soto-her-disappearance-and-stepfathers-arrest-explained.html>What happened to 13-year-old Madeline Soto?
