Who is Ian Schrager’s wife?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Ian Schrager is an American hotelier, entrepreneur, and real estate developer who has achieved international recognition for concepts that have revolutionized the food and beverage, hospitality, entertainment, retail and residential industries.</p><h2><strong>Biography</strong></h2><p>He was born in Brooklyn (July 19, 1946) to a working-class family. Ian had a close relationship with his parents, particularly with his father, who instilled a strong value system.</p><p>Schrager said about his childhood home:</p><p><strong>“When I was growing up I always had modest surroundings, but they were nice, stylish …[My parents] had a gold couch, black furniture, white walls, my parents had good taste.”</strong></p><p>Ian later added:</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72949 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ian-schrager-net-worth.jpg.webp alt="ian schrager net worth" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ian-schrager-net-worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72949 class=wp-caption-text>Ian Schrager, owner of the Paramount Hotel in New York City, 5th October 1990 – @Getty</p><p><strong>”It wasn’t fancy, it wasn’t worldly, but it was good taste.”</strong></p><p>His mother, Blanche, died when he was 23. His father, Louis (who died when Ian was 19), owned a factory in Long Branch, New Jersey, that manufactured women’s coats.</p><p>In 1968, Schrager graduated from Syracuse University and majored in economics. In 1971, he earned a JD from St. John’s University School of Law.</p><p>There he also met Steve Rubell, who would become his lifelong friend and business partner.</p><p>During an interview, Schrager explained:</p><p><strong>“We were dating the same girl, and from the way we went about competing for her, we came to respect and like each other.”</strong></p><p>Schrager continued:</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72953 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ian-schrager-family.jpg.webp alt="ian schrager family" width=750 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ian-schrager-family.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72953 class=wp-caption-text>Jade Jagger, Ian Schrager and Kate Moss at a party celebrating the launch of his new hotel – 1999 – @Getty</p><p><strong>”And the friendship just got closer and closer and closer. I would say that from the end of 1964 until Steve died in 1989 I spoke to him every single day.”</strong></p><p>In the early 1970s, Ian, Rubell, and Jon Addison bought 15 Lansdowne Street in Boston for a discotheque.</p><p>In December 1975, Ian partnered again with Rubell to open Enchanted Garden, a disco in Douglaston, Queens.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Steve Bannon Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Studio 54</strong></h2><p>Schrager is the co-owner and co-founder of Studio 54, a club located at 254 West 54th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, NYC.</p><p>Ian said:</p><p><strong>”In 1977, we opened Studio 54 in Manhattan.

The one disappointment was seeing them behave like everyone else.”</strong></p><p>In December 1978, after Steve bragged that Studio 54 made $7 million in its first year of operation and that “only the Mafia made more money,” federal agents raided Studio 54&nbsp; and confiscated garbage bags filled with cash stashed in a ceiling and large amounts of drugs.</p><p>Both pleaded guilty to tax evasion and spent 13 months in prison. Ian said:</p><p><strong>“Jail robs you of the dignity we have as human beings. It was terrible. I lost everything. After I came out I couldn’t get a liquor license, or even a credit card.”</strong></p><p>On January 30, 1981, Schrager and Rubell were released from prison to a halfway house for two and a half months.</p><h2><strong>Palladium</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72955 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/How-much-is-Ian-from-Studio-54-worth.jpg.webp alt="How much is Ian from Studio 54 worth" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/How-much-is-Ian-from-Studio-54-worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-4 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72955 class=wp-caption-text>Ian Schrager in New York City at the Gramercy Park Hotel – @Getty</p><p>After Studio 54, Rubell and Ian opened their next nightclub, Palladium, in the old Academy of Music building in NYC.
