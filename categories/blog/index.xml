His soon-to-be-ex-wife, Miriam (Léa Drucker) strongly objects to this request, citing Antoine’s history of violence against her and their older daughter Joséphine (Mathilde Auneveux). Joséphine wants nothing to do with her father, and since she is of age, Antoine cannot influence her decisions.

ラルクの実質的リーダーであり、バンドの中では最も音楽に厳しい方です。
舞台裏のエピソードなどを聞くと、
tetsuyaさんは厳しくて怖いイメージを持ちますが、
ラジオなどのメディアでのtetsuyaさんをみてると、
とても優しい性格の方だなと思います。
基本的には性格が良いと思われているtetsuyaさんですが、
それはつい最近のことで、若い頃はいろんな話がありました。
tetsuyaさんの性格が良い人なのか、悪い人なのか、
その参考になりそうなエピソードや伝説をまとめてみました。
tetsuyaの性格が良さそうな話
tetsuからtetsuyaに改名した理由 ２００９年の１２月に「tetsu」から「tetsuya」に改名しました。
デビューしてから長く「tetsu」として活動していたにも関わらず、急遽「tetsuya」に改名されたのです。
本当に長いファンからすると、今だに違和感があるそうですが、新規ファンからすると「え、tetsu？」というリアクションです。
実は、この改名した理由の１つに、ある美談が隠れているのです。
過去に長くラルクのスタッフとして活躍されていた方がいたのです。名前は通称「コメット」さんで、本名は「近藤琢哉（こんどう たくや）さんです。
ニックネーム「コメット」の由来は、”なんでも願いを叶えてくれる魔法使いみたいな人だから”ということ、バンド活動で難題にぶち当たっても、この方の努力で、なんとか乗り越えられた場面がいくつもあったからです。
裏方の雑用からなんでも積極的にこなしてきた方で、メンバーだけでなく、スタッフ、ファンからも尊敬されていた素晴らしい方でした。
その方が２００９年の１１月７日、バイク事故によって急逝してしまったのです。
亡くなってしまった後には、そのことは新聞にも取り上げられるという衝撃度でした。
tetsuさんは彼が亡くなる前、最後のライブ「TOUR2008 L’7 Trans ASIA via PARIS(DVD)」のエンディングにて、
彼の姿を映した映像を入れ、サプライズで追悼しました。
そして、tetsuさんは彼の「や」の一文字を受け継ぎ、
「tetsu」から「tetsuya」に改名されたのです。
これはあくまで一説にすぎない話ですが、多くのファンが信じていることです。
交友関係が広い tetsuさんはラルクでブレイクする前から、T.M revolutionの西川さんと友人であったり、意外な親交が多いです。
ソロ活動や、ユニット活動でもtetsuさんの顔の広さは凄まじく、同じアーティストだけでなく、多ジャンルの方まで友達になっているのです。
仮にtetsuさんが性格が悪かったら、そう簡単にたくさんの友達はできませんよね？
タバコ・ギャンブルを一切さらない ラルクといえば、ギターのケンさんが演奏中に喫煙することで知られてます。
しかし、ベースのtetsuさんは全くタバコを吸わないそうです。
さらには、ギャンブルもやりません！
旦那さんにするには、条件の良い男性なのです。。笑
性格的に、根が真面目というのが分かります。これは良い意味での真面目なのか、悪い意味での真面目なのか分かりませんが。
tetsuyaの性格が悪そうな話 番組中にブチ切れして帰った？ これは有名なエピソードですが、
１９９９年５月１日に放送された番組「ポップジャム」の中で、
tetsuyaさんが演奏の合間に怒って帰ってしまったという話。
これは都市伝説的になっていますが、
伝えられてる話と、本人談は別のようです。
当時のtestuさんはラルクが「ヴィジュアル系」と呼ばれることに抵抗があったそうですが
都市伝説では、番組のMCであった爆笑問題の太田さんが、
ラルクのことを「ヴィジュアル系」と紹介したことで、
tetsuyaさんがキレて、「HEAVEN'S DRIVE」でコーラスをしないで、
ベースをぞんざいに扱って、2曲目を演奏しないで退場、
演奏をやめて帰って中断になったとされてます。
しかし、実際は、もともと演奏される曲は別々でやりたいなど、
収録の環境で、番組と意見が合致してない部分があったそうです。
（なので２曲目をやらないで帰った理由は別にあった）
それはラルクのスタッフが番組側に、
メンバーの意思をうまく伝えてなかったことが原因で、
番組や爆笑問題の責任ではなかったそうです。
ネガティブで現実的な発言が多い
これは昔から言われていることですが、</description></item><item><title>The Meaning Behind The Song: You Found Me by Adventure Club &amp;amp; Jessica Audiffred</title><link>/the-meaning-behind-the-song-you-found-me-by-adventure-club-jessica-audiffred.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/the-meaning-behind-the-song-you-found-me-by-adventure-club-jessica-audiffred.html</guid><description>Introduction I am listening to the song “You Found Me” by Adventure Club &amp;amp; Jessica Audiffred while writing this article.
