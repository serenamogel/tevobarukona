After participating in a peaceful protest in Alabama in February 1965, he was shot by a state trooper. He died a few days later. His death inspired a voting rights march; the violence at that protest — known as "Bloody Sunday" — made more Americans favor civil rights, and made it possible to pass 1965's Voting Rights Act.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On December 16, 1938, Jimmie Lee Jackson was born in Marion, Alabama, a small town located near Selma. After fighting in the Vietnam War and spending time in Indiana, he returned to his hometown. There, he made about $6 a day as a laborer and woodcutter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jackson became a church deacon — the youngest one at his Baptist church — and fathered a daughter. Inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, he also tried to vote for the first time in his life. He made several attempts to register as a voter, but never got past the many hurdles that had been set up to keep African Americans from casting ballots.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Shooting and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On February 18, 1965, Jackson took part in a peaceful night march in Marion, held to protest the arrest of James Orange, a field secretary for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. However, even nonviolent demonstrations were opposed by the segregationists who held power in Alabama. That night, the town's streetlights were turned off; under the cover of darkness, police and state troopers attacked the protesters with clubs, sending them fleeing in different directions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Still pursued by officers, Jackson and other demonstrators went into a restaurant called Mack's Café. There, Jackson was shot in the stomach by James Bonard Fowler, a state trooper. Witnesses recounted that Jackson had been protecting his mother and 82-year-old grandfather from the troopers. Fowler, who didn't admit to the killing until a 2005 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.annistonstar.com/the-death-of-jimmie-lee-jackson/article_1290419c-ab42-50c6-ac62-c24c9bdda9f2.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Anniston Star" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Anniston Star</a>, claimed he had been acting in self-defense, and was trying to keep Jackson from grabbing his gun. “I don’t remember how many times I pulled the trigger, but I think I just pulled it once, but I might have pulled it three times,” Fowler told The Anniston Star. “I don’t remember. I didn’t know his name at the time, but his name was Jimmie Lee Jackson. He weren’t dead. He didn’t die that night. But I heard about a month later that he died.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The injured Jackson was first taken to a local hospital, then sent to a hospital in Selma. He lingered for a week before dying from his infected wound on February 26, 1965. He was only 26 years old. Though Al Lingo, head of the state troopers, had sent an arrest warrant to Jackson while he was in the hospital, Fowler had faced no punishment or disciplinary action, and was allowed to continue in his job.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Civil Rights Martyr</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jackson's shooting was condemned by leaders of the Civil Rights Movement such as <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Luther King Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> — who had visited Jackson in the hospital — <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/john-lewis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Lewis" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Lewis</a> and James Bevel. On March 3, King spoke at Jackson's funeral, where he said that Jackson had been "murdered by the brutality of every sheriff who practices lawlessness in the name of law."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jackson's death also inspired civil rights leaders to hold the Selma to Montgomery March on March 7, 1965. There was a violent response awaiting these demonstrators as well: When they arrived at Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge, police used tear gas and batons against them. Images of the violence—the protest came to be known as "Bloody Sunday"—were shared across the country, making the public more supportive of the civil rights struggle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Two weeks after "Bloody Sunday," another march set out from Selma. By the time the marchers arrived in Montgomery, there was a crowd of 25,000 people. The Voting Rights Act became law in August 1965. The legislation fought the discriminatory measures that had kept African Americans like Jackson from voting.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">James Fowler's Conviction</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">James Fowler, the state trooper who confessed to killing Jackson, did not face any immediate repercussions following the fatal shooting. It wasn't until 2007, 42 years after Jackson’s death, that Fowler was arrested and charged with first and second degree murder. Fowler initially maintained that he had acted to defend himself, but eventually accepted a plea bargain for misdemeanor manslaughter. He received a six-month jail sentence, but served only five months and was released in July 2011 because of health problems. In 2011, the FBI began investigating Fowler’s role in the 1966 death of Nathan Johnson, another Black man, who Fowler had fatally shot after he stopped Johnson for suspicion of drunk driving. Fowler died of pancreatic cancer on July 5, 2015 at the age of 81.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Jackson Lee</li><li>Birth Year: 1938</li><li>Birth date: December 16, 1938</li><li>Birth State: Alabama</li><li>Birth City: Marion</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Jimmie Lee Jackson was shot and killed by an Alabama state trooper in 1965; his death inspired a civil rights demonstration that led to the Voting Rights Act.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Civil Rights</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Sagittarius</li><li>Death Year: 1965</li><li>Death date: February 26, 1965</li><li>Death State: Alabama</li><li>Death City: Selma</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=28><ul data-node-id=30 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Jimmie Lee Jackson Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/activists/jimmie-lee-jackson</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: July 7, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: April 3, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=33 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Jimmie Jackson has joined the ranks of the many martyrs who have fallen along the way in building this great nation and in bringing us to this hour.</li><li>[Jimmie Lee Jackson] was murdered by the timidity of a federal government that can spend millions of dollars a day to keep troops in South Vietnam and cannot protect the lives of its own citizens seeking the right to vote.</li><li>[Jimmie Lee Jackson] was murdered by the brutality of every sheriff who practices lawlessness in the name of law.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyZq7a0wNJooaKlnZ6ybrjEnmSjmZOgwLC6</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kingdom-come-deliverance-find-spade.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kingdom Come: Deliverance - Where to Find a Spade</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-wayne-static-make-latest-wayne-static-net-worth-income-salary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Wayne Static Make?
