I began with this brain chemical because I had studied the activities of this powerful and ubiquitous neurotransmitter for several years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">On impulse, I listed some of the personality traits I knew were associated with specific genes in the dopamine system: the propensity to seek novelty; the willingness to take risks; spontaneity; heightened energy; curiosity; creativity; optimism; enthusiasm; mental flexibility. I decided to call those men and women who expressed the traits associated with this biology Explorers. Patrick, I would come to realize, had a good deal of the Explorer in him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">I drew another blank sheet of paper from my desk drawer. What else did I know about personality?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Well, individuals who have inherited particular genes in the serotonin system tend to be calm, social, cautious but not fearful, persis tent, loyal, fond of rules and facts and orderly. They are conventional, the guardians of tradition. And because these men and women are also skilled at building social networks and managing people in family, business and social situations, I dubbed those who had inherited this constellation of genetic traits Builders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">I had also studied testosterone. Although testosterone is often associated with males, I knew that both men and women are capable of expressing particularly strong activity in this neural system. Moreover, those who inherit this chemistry tend to be direct, decisive, focused, analytical, logical, tough-minded, exacting, emotionally contained and good at strategic thinking. They get to the point. Many are bold and competitive. They excel at figuring out machines, mathematical formulas or other rule-based systems. Many are good at understanding the structure of music, too. I named these people Directors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Last in my store of biological knowledge were some of the traits linked with estrogen. Women and men with a great deal of estrogen activity tend to see the big picture: they connect disparate facts to think contextually and holistically, expressing what I call web thinking. They are imaginative. They display superior verbal skills and excel at reading postures, gestures, facial expressions and tones of voice, known as executive social skills. They are also intuitive, sympathetic, nurturing, mentally flexible, agreeable, idealistic, altruistic and emotionally expressive. I christened the people of this broad biological type Negotiators.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Other chemical systems play a role in personality, of course. We may have as many as a hundred different kinds of neurotransmitters (smaller molecules) and some fifty types of peptides in the brain. But most keep the heart beating or orchestrate other basic functions. It is increasingly apparent that these four chemicals—dopamine, serotonin, testosterone and estrogen—play lead roles in producing aspects of personality.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Two others should be mentioned, though. Norepinephrine, a chemical closely related to dopamine, undoubtedly contributes to some of the Explorer's traits, especially their energy and impulsivity. And oxytocin—a chemical synthesized, stored and triggered (in large part) by estrogen—most likely plays a role in the Negotiator's compassion, nurturing, trust and intuition. In fact, families of chemicals produce the Explorer, Builder, Director and Negotiator. The specific activities of any one chemical are not as significant as the ratios and interactions among all of them and several other neural systems.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Nevertheless, only dopamine, serotonin, testosterone and estrogen have been directly associated with a wide range of personality traits. So variations in these four chemicals most likely form the foundation of these four basic styles of thinking and behaving.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">But does your personality type guide who you love?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">I decided to find out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prjLnmWcp51ksLa4066pnmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S7psPSaJhqamVmfKmxy56lZp6ZqLWmvtJmp56qo6S7orjIrbBmrJWowW5%2FkWxraA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mario-cantone-net-worth-167899.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mario Cantone Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gold-rush-exclusive-sees-rick-ness-face-catastrophic-circumstances.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gold Rush exclusive sees Rick Ness face catastrophic circumstances</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./new-trader-joes-products-february-2024.html>5 New Trader Joes Products to Try: February 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-13-year-old-madeline-soto-her-disappearance-and-stepfathers-arrest-explained.html>What happened to 13-year-old Madeline Soto?
