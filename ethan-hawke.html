He moved to New York City and worked steadily in films from then on. In addition to his movie work, he became an active participant in the New York theater scene and is a filmmaker in his own right. He published his first novel in 1996 and reappeared on the big screen in 1997 with Gattaca. He later starred in the critically acclaimed film Training Day (2001) with Denzel Washington, earning his first Oscar nomination. He would receive further Academy Award nominations for adapted screenplay for the films Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).

In 1988 he began attending Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh but left school when he was cast in Peter Weir's prep-school drama Dead Poet’s Society (1989).

Lead roles in White Fang and the lightweight Mystery Date (both 1991) followed. He also worked in the more intellectual Waterland, co-starring Jeremy Irons, and the World War II drama A Midnight Clear, co-starring Gary Sinise (both 1992).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to his movie work, Hawke became an active participant in the New York theater community and a filmmaker in his own right. He made his off-Broadway debut in Casanova with the New York Shakespeare Festival, and in 1991, inspired by Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater, he started the nonprofit theater company Malaparte with friends, subsequently appearing in many of the group's productions. In 1993 Hawke wrote, directed and edited a short film, Straight to One, which was screened at the Sundance Film Festival.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Reality Bites,' 'Before Sunrise'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His role as the scruffy, philosophical slacker who pines for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/winona-ryder data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Winona Ryder" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Winona Ryder</a> in Reality Bites (1994), directed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ben-stiller data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ben Stiller" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ben Stiller</a> and also featuring Janeane Garofalo and Steven Zahn, made Hawke a heartthrob for Generation X. He expanded his moody romantic-lead portfolio in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise (1995), co-starring Julie Delpy. Meanwhile, Hawke remained active with Malaparte, making his theatrical directorial debut with the company's production of Wild Dogs! in 1994. He also appeared on stage in Chicago, playing opposite Gary Sinise in the Steppenwolf production of the Sam Shepard play Buried Child.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Gattaca'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A newly buff Hawke reappeared on the big screen in the 1997 sci-fi thriller Gattaca, in which he infiltrates a society of genetically perfect humans by assuming another man's identity.

He appeared in two more Linklater films the following year: the innovative Waking Life, in which the actors, including Hawke and Julie Delpy, were filmed in live-action and then digitally animated; and Tape, a film about a love triangle of Hawke, his Dead Poets co-star and friend Robert Sean Leonard, and wife Uma Thurman.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Training Day'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hawke's biggest film of 2001 was the fast-paced action-drama hit Training Day, in which he played a rookie cop who is paired with (and schooled by) a corrupt older partner, played with fierce intensity by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/denzel-washington data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Denzel Washington" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Denzel Washington</a>. Washington attracted most of the attention for the film, which was deemed mediocre by many critics, but Hawke earned his share of recognition as well, including his first Academy Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actor. Washington won an Oscar for the film in the Best Actor category.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Boyhood,' 'Born to Be Blue'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After a long absence, Hawke was back onstage in New York City in 2001, starring in the Manhattan premiere of Sam Shepard's play The Late Henry Moss. In 2002 he appeared in Frank Whaley's The Jimmy Show, screened at Sundance, and made his own feature directorial debut with Chelsea Walls, based on the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/dylan-thomas data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dylan Thomas" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dylan Thomas</a> poem "Under Milkwood." In 2014 Hawke earned an Oscar nomination for Before Midnight (2013) in the category of Best Adapted Screenplay. He shared the nomination with actress, screenwriter and co-star Julie Delpy. That same year, he also co-starred in the acclaimed drama Boyhood, earning Oscar, Golden Globe and SAG nominations.

Hawke withstood the criticism and would go on to publish a second novel, Ash Wednesday, in 2002, as well as Rules for a Knight (2015) and Indeh: A Story of the Apache Wars (2016).</p><h2 data-node-id=29 title="Wife and Children" data-anchor-id=wife-and-children class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Wife and Children</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hawke and Uma Thurman divorced in 2005 following seven years of marriage.
